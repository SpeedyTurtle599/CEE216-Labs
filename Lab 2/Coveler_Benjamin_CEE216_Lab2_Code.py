# Steps for problem setup:
# 1) Discretize body into elements and define nodes
# @ each end of the element
#     Typically, each element has the same geometry area (A) and
#     material Youngâ€™s modulus (E)
# 2) Define geometry and loads
# 3) Set up governing equations

# Relevant equations:
# sigma = E * epsilon
# F = k * delta


# Define functions for each task
